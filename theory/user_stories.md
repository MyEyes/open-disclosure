## General
In general it seems that third party vendors have relatively similar interests to researchers towards the vendor. 

## Researcher stories
* As a researcher, I want to disclose security issues, so that they can be fixed.
* As a researcher, I want to be able to disclose an issue anonymously, so that I won't get sued or be otherwise disadvantaged.
* As a researcher, I want to be able to disclose through a third party if necessary, so that I can receive compensation for my work or to not have to directly interact with the vendor.
* As a researcher, I want to be able to guarantee that the vendor receives the issue, even when disclosing through a third party, so that I know the issue can be fixed and won't be withheld.

* As a researcher, I want my research to be easy to find, so that me and others can avoid duplicate work and to hold companies accountable with a public track record.
* As a researcher, I want my research to become public after the disclosure process, so that I can be credited and that others can learn from and build on my work.
* As a researcher, I want the disclosures details to remain secret until the issue is fixed, unless the vendor takes too long, so that the product and its customers can be safe or at least informed.
* As a researcher, I want to be able to communicate with the vendor or third party, so that questions can be answered or issues can be clarified.
* As a researcher, I want to be able to revoke further access to my research before it becomes public, so that I can control who has access to the details.

## Vendor stories
